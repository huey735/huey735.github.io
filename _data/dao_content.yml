  - title: Why?
    intro: "
            <p>Bisq trading is currently decentralized, but its revenue distribution and decision-making are not.</p>
            <p>It is critical that Bisq be resistant to censorship, and the trade protocol and P2P network achieve this—for traders.</p>
            <p>What about Bisq's developers? Project decision-making and revenue distribution are still centralized, and this creates vulnerabilities.</p>

  - title: What Is The Bisq DAO?
    intro: "
            <p>The Bisq DAO enables value transfer from traders to contributors. The BSQ token makes this possible in a decentralized way.</p>
            <p>Trading fees are distributed to contributors without the confines of a corporation or other legal entity, keeping Bisq stateless & sovereign.</p>

  - title: How Does It Work?
    intro: "
            <div class=\"subtitle pt-4\">
              Revenue distribution
            </div>

            <div class=\"small\">
              <p>
                To distribute revenue from trading fees to contributors, Bisq uses BSQ - a Bitcoin-based colored coin. Contributors are issued new BSQ when stakeholders approve their compensation requests through voting, and BSQ gets “uncolored” when traders use it to pay trading fees.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is no central entity collecting or creating BSQ—Bisq stakeholders are collectively in charge of the issuance process.
              </p>
              <p class=\"disclaimer\">
                This is not an ICO. No BSQ is sold to raise capital.
              </p>
            </div>


            <div class=\"subtitle pt-3\">
              Decision-making
            </div>

            <div class=\"small\">
              <p>
                With no CEO or central leadership team, Bisq stakeholders—traders and contributors—are the owners of Bisq.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through social consensus (via voting) they determine Bisq's project strategy.
              </p>
